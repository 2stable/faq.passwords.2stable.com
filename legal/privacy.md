### Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how 2Stable ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our services. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and will only collect the minimal data necessary to operate and improve our software. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise defined here, terms used in this document have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

### Our Commitment to Privacy
At 2Stable, your privacy is a core principle. We believe that the less data we collect, the better. If we don’t have your information, we can’t lose it, misuse it, or expose it. That’s why we’ve designed our products to collect as little information as possible.

### Personal Data
We do **not** collect or have access to the personal data you store within our application, **Password Manager**. All data saved in the app is **fully encrypted** before being stored in your **iCloud account**, and it is synchronized securely across your devices. Your data remains entirely private — it is encrypted in such a way that not even 2Stable or Apple can read or decrypt it.

To help maintain and improve the app, we may collect limited technical information:
- **Usage analytics** to understand general app behavior
- **Subscription validation** to verify and manage premium access
- **Crash reports** to improve stability and performance

This data is minimal, anonymized wherever possible, and used solely to enhance your experience. The only personal information we may receive is your **email address**, and only if you choose to contact us for support.

### Subscription Validation
To manage and verify your subscription status, we use the **RevenueCat** SDK, which helps us securely validate in-app purchases and manage access to premium features.

As part of this process, the following data may be collected:
- Receipt validation
- In-app purchase details
- Subscription product identifiers
- Current subscription status

This information is used solely to confirm your eligibility for premium features and is never used for tracking or advertising.

You can learn more about RevenueCat’s SDK data handling practices in their [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

### Usage Analytics
To help us improve **Password Manager** and better understand how it's used, we use **Mixpanel** to collect anonymized usage analytics. The data collected includes non-personal information such as:
- App interactions
- Feature usage
- General engagement patterns

This data is aggregated and not linked to your identity. It is never used for tracking or advertising purposes. We rely on this information solely to improve the app and deliver a better experience.

All analytics data is handled in accordance with [Mixpanel’s Privacy Policy](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

### Crash Logs
We use **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect crash reports that help us identify bugs and improve the stability of **Password Manager**. These reports contain only technical information related to the crash and do **not** include any of your personal data or content stored in the app.

The crash data may include:
- Anonymized bundle identifier and app version
- Device type, CPU architecture, and operating system version
- Timestamp of the crash
- A generated UUID (used to avoid duplicate reports)
- Exception details, such as the class name and error message (if applicable)
- Low-level crash data, including instruction pointers, method or function names, signal info, and memory register states
- Application log file at the time of the crash

This data is used exclusively to diagnose issues and improve app performance. All crash reports are processed in accordance with [Firebase’s Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

### Questions or Concerns?
