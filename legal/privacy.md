### Crash Logs
Crash logs are automatically sent on the next app start (by default). These logs contain anonymized data about the crash, aiding us in identifying the cause and potentially providing a fix in a future update. They do not contain data or metadata about the content you create with our software. Here's what we collect:

1. Anonymized bundle identifier and short bundle version string of your app.
2. Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system.
3. Timestamp of the crash.
4. A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports.
5. If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception.
6. Low-level crash data, including instruction pointer, method or function names, signal data, pointer registers, and information about the loaded binary images.
7. The application log file.

We use Crashlytics service to collect and manage this data.
